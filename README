Merger is a simple little script written and tested in Python 2.6.1. Its
simple goal is to quickly create a lot of text files from a template
and a CSV data file. Examples of the file formats it expects can be
found in the examples/ directory.

The first line of the CSV must contain field names which 
correspond to the template variable fields. Variable fields in 
the text file must be flanked by percent signs (%). The first
value of each CSV record must contain the output filename for
that record.

For example, here are the first 2 lines of a CSV data file, data.csv:

NAME,NOUN_1,VERB_1,NOUN_2
"file_one","fox","lept","emu"

Here is an example template file, template.txt:

The quick, red %NOUN_1% %VERB_1% over the lazy brown %NOUN_2%

Here's the command to run:

$ mergency.py data.csv template.tpl

The output is a file named file_one.txt, and its contents are:

The quick, red fox lept over the lazy brown emu.
